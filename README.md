Map Control
>
> 1. Compute the **Area Influence** of each players in the same team, on a edgeless plain.
> 2. Define the concept of Pitch Control, thinking about the asymmetrical of CSGO.
> 3. Take advantage of DFS to build up the first mask : **block_mask**.
> 4. Depending on the view angle, build up the second mask : **viewmodel mask**.
> 5. Overlap the Pitch Control Surface with two masks.
